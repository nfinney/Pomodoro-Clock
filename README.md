This is the final Web Dev 101 project from theodinproject.com.<br />
The goal is to build Pomodore Clock using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.<br />
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system where you work for a period of time (25 mins) then take a short break (5 mins), then work for a period of time then take a short break, and so on.
